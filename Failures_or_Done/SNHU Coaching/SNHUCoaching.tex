\begin{cvletter}

Since leaving my position as Research Scientist at Landmark College in June, I have been providing full-time care for my 5 year-old son and volunteering in support of a massive renovation of his non-profit preschool: Willow Blossom Learning Center. In my role as Board President, I have collaborated with the Center Director and Program staff to upgrade the building's HVAC system, re-design classrooms, and secure the funding needed for these renovations. I have also volunteered hundreds of hours to complete the carpentry and painting necessary to create a safer and more functional space for the Program. As we plan to re-open the Center in April, I am currently seeking part-time positions that allow me to provide administrative support to the Center and  afford me the opportunity to apply my skills as an educator. 

The majority of my career in education has been focused on supporting neurodivergent students, and I have provided coaching and instruction to students in a variety of settings. My work with students has rarely been just about academics: in 1:1 and group contexts, I have helped students to navigate social challenges, organize their time or physical space, manage anxiety and monitor their mental heatlh. I find writing about my strengths deeply uncomfortable, but: I do think that my experience working with a wide-range of students would serve me well in connecting with and supporting any SNHU student who seeks my support. 

I'm excited by the opportunity to work with neurodivergent students and help them achieve their academic and career goals. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my qualifications for this position in an interview.  Thank you for your consideration. 
\\\\
Best,
\end{cvletter}
