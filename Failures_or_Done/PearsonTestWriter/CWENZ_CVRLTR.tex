%	LETTER CONTENT
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}

In addition to the five years I spent teaching high school English and History to students with learning differences, I have spent the last 6 years teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in reading and writing instruction. I believe the skills I have developed as a teacher, teacher educator and researcher align closely with the responsbilities and skills outlined in the description for this job. 

Since leaving my position as Research Scientist at Landmark College in 2020, I have been teaching as an Adjunct Professor at UConn and working to complete my PhD. I have also provided full-time care for my 5 year-old son and volunteered in support of a much-needed renovation of his non-profit preschool: Willow Blossom Learning Center. In my role as Board President, I have collaborated with the Center Director and staff to upgrade the building's HVAC systems, re-design classrooms, and secure the funding needed for these projects. I have also volunteered hundreds of hours to complete the carpentry and painting necessary to create a safer and more functional space for the Program. Now that Willow Blossom has re-opened I am seeking a position that allows my family to remain in the Pioneer Valley and affords me the opportunity to apply my skills as an educator and researcher. 

In August, I will complete my PhD in Curriculum and Instruction; my graduate studies have built on my classroom teaching experience and I have focused on adolescent literacy instruction, assessment and intervention. Much of my scholarly has focused on "disciplinary literacy": an approach to K-12 literacy instruction that focuses on developing students' literacies through authentic engagement in disciplinary content and practices. As a Graduate Assistant and Adjunct Professor at the UConn, I have applied these ideas to courses on literacy instruction for pre-service teacher candidates (including pre-service ELA teachers) and students in the Literacy Specialist Program. I am confident that my experience and training as an ELA teacher, teacher educator and literacy researcher has prepared me well to meet the demands of this position. 

Although working for a company like Pearson would be a departure from my prior experience, I have thrived working both independently and on teams in numerous settings. Working directly with students always requires juggling multiple and competing priorities and approaching every day with flexibility and a willingness to learn; I believe the skills and competencies I've developed as an educator would serve me well in this position and make me an asset to the company and my co-workers. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you in an interview and I thank you for your consideration.

Best,
