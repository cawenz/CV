\begin{cvletter}

Since leaving my position as Research Scientist at Landmark College in June, I have been providing full-time care for my 5 year-old son and volunteering in support of a massive renovation of his non-profit preschool: Willow Blossom Learning Center. In my role as Board President, I have collaborated with the Center Director and Program staff to upgrade the building's HVAC system, re-design classrooms, and secure the funding needed for these renovations. I have also volunteered hundreds of hours to complete the carpentry and painting necessary to create a safer and more functional space for the Program. I share this with you because my efforts at Willow Blosson are indicative of the diligence and dedication I bring to all of my work. As we plan to re-open the Center in April, I am currently seeking a position that allows my family to remain in the Pioneer Valley long-term, and affords me the opportunity to apply my skills as an educator. 

I am incrediby excited by the opportunity to collaborate with you and the interdisciplinary teams you have assembled to support faculty and improve teaching and learning at Smith. I also believe that my experience designing online and hybrid courses as well as my expertise in teacher education, literacy instruction, and universal design make me an ideal candidate for this position. Further, because my teaching and scholarly work has been focused on literacy across the curriculum, I have worked with educators across disciplines and developed strong skills in understanding and responding to diverse pedagogical priorities. Finally, I have extensive experience presenting to K-12 and college educators on a wide variety of topics, including assistive technology, executive funtioning supports, and learning design. 

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you in an interview; further I would love to meet the ITS and LRT teams, and learn more about your vision for instructional innovation at Smith. Thank you for your consideration.  


\\\\
Best,
\end{cvletter}
