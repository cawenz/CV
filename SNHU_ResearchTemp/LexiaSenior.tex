\begin{cvletter}

I write as an applicant for the position of \textbf{Senior Analyst, Product Research (JR103581)}. Over the past year, in addition to providing full-time care for my five-year old son, I have spent several days helping my nephew with his remote schooling. His favorite part of my days with him (besides Lunch!) was the time he spent on the Core5 app. As his uncle, I loved seeing him engage with a learning program that captivated him. As a researcher and literacy educator, I was impressd with his growth as a reader and the quality of the instruction the program delivers. As a result, I am incredibly excited by the opportunity to work on the development and refinement of Lexia products.

Although I am early in my career as a literacy researcher, and I have direct experience conducting both qualitative and quantitative research, including working with large data sets. For the past 18 months I have been working under a data-sharing agreement with the Reading Recovery Council of North America (RR). In collaboration with my colleague Dr. Rachael Gabriel, I have designed and conducted a secondary analysis of seven years of assessment data on RR students from across the country (n > 350,000). The goal of this project is to use recent advances in finite mixture regression models and multi-level analysis to identify patterns of response to the Reading Recovery intervention. We hope that the insights generated by our analysis can lead to improvements not just to the differentiation of the RR intervention, but to early literacy instruction in general. To complete this project, I cleaned and matched the RR data with the school, district and state data from the National Center for Educational Statistics' Common Core of Data (CCD). In addition, the rich CCD data and newly developed R packages allowed us to generate novel measures of segregation and neighborhood poverty. These measures provide us with a deeper understanding of differences in the delivery and response to RR across the country. All of this to say: I believe that the technical and analytic skills I have developed on this and other projects would make me an asset to the Research and Analytics team at Lexia. 

Finally, I believe the communication and leadership skills I developed over many years of working closely with diverse groups of students, families, and educators would allow me to succeed in this position. After several years of (somewhat) lonely work in Academia, I relish the opportunity to join a dynamic Research team and collaborate across teams and departments.  I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn more about Lexia, this position, and to discuss my qualifications with you in an interview. Thank you for your consideration.  

\\\\
Best,
\end{cvletter}
